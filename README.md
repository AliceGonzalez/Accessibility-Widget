# Readability Widget

This is a readability widget that you can install on your website. It helps balance competing accessibility needs by offering an extra set of optional accommodations. 

**Note**: This widget alone will not make your website accessible; it is intended to be additive. We recommend that you ensure your site is WCAG-compliant before adding this widget.


## Features

- **Warm background**: peachy color overlay
- **OpenDyslexic font**: affects all text 
- **Highlight links**: in yellow 
- **Hide images**: blanks them out

Final Embedded code sample that will be placed in the Look & Feel > Custom JS/CSS Section:
<script src="https://<screename>.github.io/Accessibility-Widget/widget.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://<screenname>.github.io/Accessibility-Widget/widget.css">

**Copy/Paste code in widget.html file as well**

Other ways to embbed code: Render HTML via JS file instead of providing HTML code to the embedded code.
### Requirements: none

- No additional JavaScript libraries are required. It’s vanilla!
- Not required: the OpenDyslexic font file is included in this package.
- The _paq variable in widget.js is used to load Matomo Analytics. If you use Matomo, you may want to adjust the custom event tracking in widget.js. If you don’t use Matomo, this variable is extraneous and can be removed or kept - it shouldn’t impact the widget’s functionality.
